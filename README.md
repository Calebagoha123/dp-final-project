# Project Description

This project is focused on analyzing and processing music data, including audio features, song lyrics, and trends over time. It leverages music datasets from different sources to explore patterns in music popularity and lyrical content. Key components include:

- **Data Collection**: Songs were scraped from Spotify using the `song_scraper.py` script, while lyrics were gathered from Genius using the `lyrics_scraper.py` script.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Insights are derived using notebooks such as `eda.ipynb` and `word_analysis.ipynb`.


The project aims to uncover trends in music and lyrics, providing a deeper understanding of the factors influencing song popularity.
