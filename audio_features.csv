I could tell it was your ex by your tone (Tone)
Why is she callin' now after so long?

Now what is it that she wants?
Tell me, what is it that she needs?

I can feel the magic floating in the air
Being with you gets me that way
I watch the sunlight dance across your face, and I've
Never been this swept away

[Verse 2]
All my thoughts just seem to settle on the breeze
When I'm lying wrapped up in your arms
The whole world just fades away
The only thing I hear
Is the beating of your heart

[Chorus]
'Cause I can feel you breathe, it's washing over me
And suddenly, I'm melting into you
There's nothing left to prove
Baby, all we need is just to be
Caught up in the touch, slow and steady rush
And baby, isn't that the way that love's supposed to be?
I can feel you breathe
Just breathe

In a way, I know my heart is waking up
As all the walls come tumbling down
Closer than I've ever felt before
And I know, and you know
There's no need for words right now

Y'all gon' make me act a fool
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me lose my cool

Yall gon make me lose my mood
Drop it like it’s hot I got heat make ‘em move yea
Stick n move my stick is loose I gotta prove that
My whole gang got nothing to lose
Right hand to God, left one on my choppa
Play with mе you get crucified, leavе your body filled with loose crews
You lose, you claim you a leader and you came at a leader now your whole crew losing

Huh it’s funny cuz I bet you liked it
Guns, money the power and respect got it
Seems like the rest are left guessing what is really real
While the major crowd feeling how we feel
The art we calling hip hop is in danger
Watch media starts pushing the narrative of danger
And we ain’t.. making it better we just trusting the strangers
A step closer to be perceived as deviants than angels

Y'all gon' make me lose my mind

Y'all gon' make me act a fool
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me lose my cool
Up in here, up in here


[Verse 2 : NewGenRapper]
A simple error and then we wake up and look at the
Mirror and your reflection looking like a deviant
That’s probably why descendants of the gangsta rap study
Ways to appear as outlaw heroes
Those people appeal as necessary, fit to carry
But all have obituaries, huh
2022 I guess that’s what is missing
Too many rappin bout the streets but no one really live in em

[Pre-Chorus : NewGenRapper]
Huh it’s funny cuz I bet you liked it
Guns, money the power and respect got it
Seems like the rest are left guessing what is really real
While the major crowd feeling how we feel
The art we calling hip hop is in danger
Watch media starts pushing the narrative of danger
And we ain’t making it better we just trusting the strangers
A step closer to be perceived as deviants than angels

Y'all gon' make me lose my mind
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me go all out
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me act a fool
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me lose my cool
Up in here, up in here

[Verse 3 : NewGenRapper]
I swear we in danger
More money, more problem
But also more media attention
It’s building up tension
And blame of millions of Instagram users calling you names cuz you told on your friends
But who are your friends tho
A bunch of known criminals who you payed so you could prove that you’re dangerous
Now who is the danger
Is it the media, the code of street or simply the entertainers

[Pre-Chorus : NewGenRapper]
But it’s funny cuz I bet you liked it
Guns, money the power and respect got it
Seems like the rest are left guessing what is really real
While the major crowd feeling how we feel
It’s funny cuz I bet you liked it
Watch media starts pushing the narrative of danger
It’s funny cuz I bet you liked it
Fun- Funny cuz I bet you liked it...


[Chorus: DMX]
Y'all gon' make me lose my mind
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me go all out
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me act a fool
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me lose my cool
Up in here, up in here

Fierce nipple pierce, you got me sprung with your tongue ring
And I ain't gonna lie 'cause your loving gets me high
So to keep you by my side, there's nothing that I won't try
Butterflies in her eyes and looks to kill
Time is passin', I'm askin', ""Could this be real?""
'Cause I can't sleep, I can't hold still
The only thing I really know is she got sex appeal
I can feel, too much is never enough

I don't deserve you unless it's some kind of hidden message
To show me life is precious, then I guess it's true
But to tell the truth, I really never knew 'til I met you
See, I was lost and confused, twisted and used up
Knew a better life existed, but thought that I missed it
My lifestyle's wild, I was livin' like a wild child
Trapped on a short leash, paroled the police files
So yo, what's happenin' now?
I see the sun breakin' down into dark clouds
And a vision of you standin' out in a crowd, so

I used to think that happy endings were only in the books I read
But you made me feel alive when I was almost dead
You filled that empty space with the love I used to chase
And as far as I can see, it don't get better than this
So butterfly, here is a song and it's sealed with a kiss
And a thank you, miss

He spends his nights in California
Watching the stars on the big screen
Then he lies awake and he wonders
""Why can’t that be me?""
'Cause in his life he's filled with all these good intentions
He’s left a lot of things he’d rather not mention right now
But just before he says goodnight
He looks up with a little smile at me and he says

[Chorus]
If I could be like that
I would give anything
Just to live one day, in those shoes
If I could be like that
What would I do?
What would I do?

Now and dreams we run

[Verse 2]
She spends her days up in the north park
Watching the people as they pass
And all she wants is just a little piece of this dream
Is that too much to ask?
With a safe home, and a warm bed
On a quiet little street
All she wants is just that something to hold onto
That’s all she needs
Yeah

I would give anything
Just to live one day, in those shoes

Alright (Can you fill me in?)
Come on
Can you fill me in?
What you want? What you want me to do, baby?
Can you fill me in?
Let's talk about it

[Verse 1]
I was checkin' this girl next door when her parents went out
She phoned, said, ""Hey boy, come on right around""
So I knock at the door
You were standin' with a bottle of red wine, ready to pour
Dressed in long black satin and lace to the floor
So I went in, then we sat down, start kissing, caressing
Told me about Jacuzzi, sounded interesting
So we jumped right in
All calls diverted to answer phone
Please leave a message after the tone
I mean, me and her parents were kind of cool
But they were the fine line between me and you
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents tryna find out what we were up to

[Chorus]
Saying, ""Why were you creeping 'round late last night?
Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light?
Now you're dressed in black
When I left, you were dressed in white
Can you fill me in?""
Calls diverted to answer phone
Red wine bottle, half the contents gone
Midnight return, Jacuzzi turned on
Can you fill me in? (It's another one, it's another one)


[Verse 2]
Whenever the coast was clear and she'd ask me to come out
I'd say, ""Hey girl, come on right around""
So she knocked at the door
I was standing with the keys in my hand to the four by four
Jumped in my ride, checkin' that nobody saw
The club we went in
We got down bounced- bounced to the rhythm
Saw it was early morning
Thought we'd better be leavin'
So I gave you my jacket for you to hold
Told you to wear it 'cause you felt cold
I mean, me and her didn't mean to break the rules
I weren't trying to play your mum and dad for fools
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents tryna find out what we were up to

[Chorus]
Saying, ""Why can't you keep your promises no more?
Say you'll be home by twelve, come strolling in at four?
Out with the girls, but leaving with the boy next door""
Can you fill me in? (Fill me in)
Wearing a jacket, whose property?
Said you'd been queuing for a taxi
But you left all your money on the TV (Can you tell me?)
Can you fill me in? (Can you fill me in?)

To explain in due time, all I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day

Watch the time go right out the window

Remembering all the times you fought with me

'Cause nobody wants to see Marshall no more, they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well, if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump-start my heart quicker

By the doctor when I'm not cooperating
When I'm rockin' the table while he's operating (Hey)
You waited this long, now stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They tried to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me
So come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that, cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready, 'cause this shit's about to get heavy

Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feelin' like prisoners, helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, ""Bitch""
A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, pollutin' the airwaves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissin' my ass
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass, you asked for me?
Well, I'm back, da-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in, and then I'm gonna
Enter in and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing, ""Attention, please""
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?

Now, let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults

Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But, sometimes, the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene (Yeah)
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do Black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey)
There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'd be so empty without me

When I roll twenty deep, it's twenty nines in the club (Yeah)
Niggas heard I fuck with Dre, now they wanna show me love
When you sell like Eminem, then the hoes, they wanna fuck (Woo)
Look homie, ain't nothin' changed, hoes down, G's up
I see Xzibit in the cut, hey, nigga, roll that weed up (Roll that)
If you watch how I move, you'll mistake me for a player or pimp
Been hit with a few shells, but I don't walk with a limp (I'm aight)
In the hood in L.A., they sayin', ""50, you hot"" (Uh-huh)
They like me, I want 'em to love me like they love Pac
But holla in New York, the niggas'll tell you I'm loco (Yeah)
And the plan is to put the rap game in a chokehold (Uh-huh)

Got a mil' out the deal and I'm still on the grind (Woo)

That bought me all my fancy things
My crib, my cars, my clothes, my jewels
Look, nigga, I done came up and I ain't changed (What? What? Yeah)

[Verse 2]
And you should love it way more than you hate it
Nigga, you mad? I thought that you'd be happy I made it (Woo)
I'm that cat by the bar toastin' to the good life
You that faggot-ass nigga tryna pull me back, right?
When my joint get to bumpin' in the club, it's on
I wink my eye at your bitch, if she smiles, she gone
If the roof on fire, let the motherfucker burn
If you talkin' about money, homie, I ain't concerned
I'ma tell you what Banks told me, ""Cuz, go 'head, switch the style up
If niggas hate, then let 'em hate, and watch the money pile up""
Or we can go upside your head with a bottle of bub'
They know where we fuckin' be

On a cobweb afternoon in a room full of emptiness
By a freeway, I confess I was lost in the pages
Of a book full of death, reading how we'll die alone
And if we're good, we'll lay to rest anywhere we wanna go

[Chorus]
In your house, I long to be
Room by room, patiently
I'll wait for you there like a stone
I'll wait for you there alone

[Verse 2]
And on my deathbed, I will pray to the gods and the angels
Like a pagan to anyone who will take me to heaven
To a place I recall, I was there so long ago
The sky was bruised, the wine was bled, and there you led me on

What's wrong with the world, Mama?
People livin' like they ain't got no mamas
I think the whole world's addicted to the drama
Only attracted to things that'll bring you trauma
Overseas, yeah, we tryna stop terrorism
But we still got terrorists here livin'
In the USA, the big CIA
The Bloods and the Crips and the KKK
But if you only have love for your own race
Then you only leave space to discriminate
And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate, then you're bound to get irate, yeah
Madness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how anger works and operates
Man, you gotta have love just to set it straight
Take control of your mind and meditate
Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
People killin', people dyin'
Children hurt, and you hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach?
And would you turn the other cheek?
Father, father, father, help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questioning
Where is the love?

(Love) Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love, the love, the love?

[Verse 2: Taboo]
It just ain't the same, old ways have changed
New days are strange, is the world insane?
If love and peace is so strong
Why are there pieces of love that don't belong?
Nations droppin' bombs
Chemical gases filling lungs of little ones
With ongoing sufferin' as the youth die young
So ask yourself, is the lovin' really gone?
So I can ask myself, really, what is going wrong
With this world that we livin' in? People keep on givin' in
Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends
Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother
A war is goin' on, but the reason's undercover
The truth is kept secret, and swept under the rug
If you never know truth, then you never know love
Where's the love, y'all? Come on (I don't know)
And where's the truth, y'all? Come on (I don't know)
And where's the love y'all?

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
People killin', people dyin'

[Verse 3: apl.de.ap, apl.de.ap & will.i.am]
I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder
As I'm gettin' older, y'all people gets colder
Most of us only care about money-makin'
Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction
Wrong information always shown by the media
Negative images is the main criteria
Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinema
Yo, whatever happened to the values of humanity? (Yeah)
Whatever happened to the fairness and equality? (Yeah)
Instead of spreading love, we spreading animosity (Yeah)
Lack of understanding leading us away from unity
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down
It's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under
Gotta keep my faith alive 'til love is found
Now ask yourself

I know I can
Be what I wanna be
If I work hard at it
I'll be where I wanna be
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

[Verse 1]
Be – b-boys and girls, listen up
You can be anything in the world, in God we trust
An architect, doctor, maybe an actress
But nothing comes easy, it takes much practice
Like, I met a woman who's becoming a star
She was very beautiful, leaving people in awe
Singing songs, Lena Horne, but the younger version
Hung with the wrong person, got her strung on that heroin
Cocaine, sniffing up drugs, all in her nose
Could've died, so young, now looks ugly and old
No fun, 'cause now when she reaches for hugs, people hold they breath
'Cause she smells of corrosion and death
Watch the company you keep and the crowd you bring
'Cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing
So if you gonna be the best, I'ma tell you how
Put your hands in the air, and take the vow


[Chorus]
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

[Verse 2]
Be – b-boys and girls, listen again
This is for grown-looking girls who's only 10
The ones who watch videos and do what they see
As cute as can be, up in the club with fake ID
Careful, 'fore you meet a man with HIV
You can host the TV, like Oprah Winfrey
Whatever you decide, be careful – some men be
Rapists – so act your age, don't pretend to be
Older than you are, give yourself time to grow
You thinking he can give you wealth, but so?
Young boys, you can use a lot of help, you know?
You thinking life's all about smoking weed and ice
You don't wanna be my age and can't read and write
Begging different women for a place to sleep at night
Smart boys turn to men, and do whatever they wish
If you believe you can achieve, then say it like this


[Chorus]
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

[Verse 3]
Be – be–fore we came to this country
We were kings and queens, never porch monkeys
There was empires in Africa called Kush
Timbuktu, where every race came to get books
To learn from Black teachers, who taught Greeks and Romans
Asians, Arabs, and gave them gold, when
Gold was converted to money, it all changed
Money then became empowerment for Europeans
The Persian military invaded
They heard about the gold, the teachings, and everything sacred
Africa was almost robbed naked
Slavery was money, so they began making slave ships
Egypt was the place that Alexander The Great went
He was so shocked at the mountains with Black faces
Shot up they nose, to impose, what basically
Still goes on today, you see?
If the truth is told, the youth can grow
They learn to survive, until they gain control
Nobody says you have to be gangstas, hoes
Read more, learn more, change the globe
Ghetto children, do your thing
Hold your head up, little man, you're a king!
Young princess, when you get your wedding ring
Your man will sing, ""She's my Queeeeeen!""


[Chorus]
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)

And out of the doubt that fills your mind
I somehow find you and I collide

Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night

Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all, you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence
Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
Pray to God He hears you
And pray to God He hears you, and

You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or break with the ones you've followed
He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came

On a balcony in summer air

See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess

We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew

Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh

And I feel awkward as I should

Since I thought you and me

Well, I am imagining a dark lit place
Or your place or my place

I wanna make you move because you're standing still

You'll probably move right through me on my way to you

I'm looking too desperately
But so far has not been fun, I should just stay home

This time, I wonder what it feels like
To find the one in this life
The one we all dream of
But dreams just aren't enough
So I'll be waiting for the real thing
I'll know it by the feeling
The moment when we're meeting
Will play out like a scene
Straight off the silver screen
So I'll be holding my breath
Right up 'til the end
Until that moment when
I find the one that I'll spend forever with

[Chorus]
'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me like that
'Cause nobody wants to do it on their own (Their own)
And everyone wants to know they're not alone (Not alone)
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere (The same somewhere)
There's gotta be somebody for me out there

[Verse 2]
Tonight, out on the street, out in the moonlight
And dammit, this feels too right
It's just like déja vu, me standing here with you
So I'll be holding my breath
Could this be the end?
Is it that moment when
I find the one that I'll spend forever with?

(To take a stand, to take a stand) It's been a ride
(Everybody, everybody) I guess I had to
(Come take my hand, come take my hand) Go to that place to get to this one
(We'll walk this road together, through the storm) Now some of you
(Whatever weather, cold or warm) Might still be in that place
(Just lettin' you know that you're not alone) If you're tryna get out
(Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road) Just follow me, I'll get you there

[Verse 1]
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'ma do somethin', I do it
I don't give a damn what you think, I'm doin' this for me
So fuck the world, feed it beans, it's gassed up if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony
No ifs, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album
He's still shittin' whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game like a ""Fuck you"" for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
And fuck the whole universe

Okay, quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm for you to know it's a wrap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
For that, fuck your feelings, instead of gettin' crowned, you're gettin' capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was ""ehh""
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack-blaow
'Cause I ain't playin' around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryna figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out, but I guess I didn't
This fuckin' black cloud still follows me around
But it's time to exorcise these demons
These motherfuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now

Come take my hand, come take my hand

And I just can't keep livin' this way
So startin' today
I'm breakin' out of this cage
I'm standin' up, I'ma face my demons
I'm mannin' up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now

It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me

So I could come back a brand-new me, you helped see me through

But they can do little to the middle finger

My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead: no more beef lingers
No more drama from now on
I promise to focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it

If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses

Lord, make me a rainbow, I'll shine down on my mother

Ain't even gray, but she buries her baby

And maybe then you'll hear the words I've been singin'
Funny when you're dead, how people start listenin'

I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light

And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

To be right where you are
How old is your soul?

In my mind when she's not right there beside me

Wanna hear her say is ""Are you mine?""

Are you mine?
Are you mine? Oh, ah

Somewhere another pretty vein just died (Died)
I've got the scars from tomorrow and I wish you could see
That you're the antidote to everything except for me
Through a constellation of tears on your lashes
Burn everything you love, then burn the ashes
In the end everything collides, my childhood
Spat back out the monster that you see

[Chorus]
Well, you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go

[Post-Chorus]
And you let her go

[Verse 1]
Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow and they go so fast
You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies

[Chorus]
But you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go


[Verse 2]
Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty feeling in your heart
'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast
Well, you see her when you fall asleep
But never to touch and never to keep
'Cause you loved her too much and you dived too deep

Well, you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow

Over its six-minute run-time, he references comic books, throws back to his old songs, and raps crazily fast.

In a Q&A with Rolling Stone… Read More [Intro]
""Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings""
""But I'm only going to get this one chance"" (Six minutes—, six minutes—)
""Something's wrong, I can feel it"" (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!)
""Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what. 
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble; 
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances""
""You are just what the doc ordered""

[Chorus]
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot
[Verse 1]
But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpièce


[Chorus]
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got

[Verse 2]
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!)
MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to ""bus the rhyme""
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run–D.M.C., and induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
Little gay-lookin' boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy (Ha-ha!)
You're witnessin' a mass-occur
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy
""Oy vey, that boy's gay!""—that's all they say, lookin' boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a ""way to go"" from your label every day, lookin' boy
Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?
I get a ""hell yeah"" from Dre, lookin' boy
I'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit
Get outta my face, lookin' boy!
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause—


[Chorus]
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod
This planet's Krypton—no, Asgard, Asgard

[Verse 3]
So you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin
You rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off, then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
But I got your mom deep-throatin'
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothin' in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you like that one line
I said on ""I'm Back"" from The Mathers LP 1 when I
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal!
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, ""Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!""
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
""Oh, he's too mainstream.""
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
""It's not hip-hop, it's pop,""—'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it
""I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use.""
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!
Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel
I'ma sleep in the front seat
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still ""Chunky but Funky""
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have, then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake 'em a cake then?
Don't mistake him for Satan
It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard—be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a god?",363521,True,0.708,0.843,7,-2.66,1,0.314,0.397,0.0,0.799,0.625,148.14,4,hip-hop

My lover's got humour
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshipped her sooner
If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's gettin' more bleak
A fresh poison each week
We were born sick, you heard them say it
My church offers no absolutes
She tells me, ""Worship in the bedroom""
The only heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick, but I love it
Command me to be well

Amen, amen

[Verse 2]
If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice
Drain the whole sea, get somethin' shiny
Somethin' meaty for the main course
That's a fine lookin' high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starvin' faithful
That looks tasty, that looks plenty
This is hungry work

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, so you can sharpen your knife

No masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then, I am human, only then, I am clean

Kept on the inside and no sunlight
Sometimes a shadow wins
But I wonder what would happen if you

Fallen for the fear

Maybe one of these days, you can let the light in
And show me, how big your brave is

Remember me for centuries

Is all it will take
We'll go down in history

Hey-ya, oh, hey, hey-ya

[Verse 1]
Mummified my teenage dreams
No, it's nothing wrong with me
The kids are all wrong, the story's all off
Heavy metal broke my heart
Come on, come on and let me in
Bruises on your thighs like my fingerprints
And this is supposed to match the darkness that you felt
I never meant for you to fix yourself

And I can't stop 'til the whole world knows my name
'Cause I was only born inside my dreams
Until you die for me, as long as there's a light
My shadow's over you
'Cause I, I am the opposite of amnesia
And you're a cherry blossom, you're about to bloom
You look so pretty, but you're gone so soon

It's a little blurry how the whole thing started
I don't even really know what you intended
Thought that you were cute and you could make me jealous
Poured it down, so I poured it down
Next thing that I know, I'm in a hotel with you
You were talkin' deep like it was mad love to you
You wanted my heart, but I just liked your tattoos
Poured it down, so I poured it down

You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth

Talkin' 'bout a girl, 'bout a girl with my name
Sayin' that I hurt you, but I still don't get it
You didn't love me, no, not really
Wait
I could've really liked you
I'll bet, I'll bet that's why I keep on thinkin' 'bout you
It's a shame (Shame), you said I was good
So I poured it down, so I poured it down

I got up late again today
And I'm scared of everything
I don't dare to dream
I've got a dark imagination
These hours waste away
A debt I'll never pay
I'm talking to the walls
But the walls keep caving in
They amplify my thoughts
I really want a conversation
But I let it slip away
A debt I'll never pay

Worry, worry, oh
It's funny how it changes
When nothing really changes at all

Am I jaded? Am I meant to feel this way?
I'm a loser, getting beat by my own game
But if I falter, well, at least it was my mistake
Oh, at least it was my mistake 'cause I choose to be this way
I'm a loser, and I self-deprecate
So when I falter, well, at least it was my mistake

I saw my friend today
She tried to comfort me
But I turned her away
There's magic in this misery
So no matter what you say
I don't think I'll ever change

I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true

[Verse 1]
Give me a day or two to think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do, mm-mm
Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to (When I asked you to)
Be cool about what I was tellin' you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do (What you said you'd do)

Drivin' home under the influence
You scared me to death, but I'm wastin' my breath
'Cause you only listen to your fuckin' friends
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
You made me hate this city

[Verse 3]
And I don't talk shit about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me fuckin' sad
So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I
Shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid

Why we got good shit, don't embrace it?
Why the feel for the need to replace me?

I kept quiet so I could keep you

And I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah

Loved you at your worst, but that didn't matter

Guess you didn't cheat, but you're still a traitor

Now you bring her around just to shut me down
Show her off like she's a new trophy
And I know if you were true, there's no damn way that you
Could fall in love with somebody that quickly

All the questions you used to avoid
Ain't it funny? Remember I brought her up
And you told me I was paranoid?

I don't let bitches get to me, I fuck they man if they try
I got a princess face, a killer body, samurai mind
They can't be Nicki, they so stupid, I just laugh when they try
A thong bikini up my ass, I think I'll go for a dive
His ex-bitch went up against me, but she didn't survive
On applications I write ""pressure"" 'cause that’s what I apply (Brr)

You're almost there, but don't panic
There's still more music to come
Before you're completely engulfed in the blissful embrace of that little light you see in the distance
Soon you'll be healed, forgiven, and refreshed
Free from all trauma, pain, guilt, and shame
You may even forget your own name
But before you dwell in that house forever

For I have seen the ending and there is no ascending rise

That my end will be torture beneath the earth
'Cause I don't see what they see when death is staring at me
I see a window, a limit, to live it, or not at all

Sittin' in the car, listenin' to Blonde, fallin' for each other
Pink and orange skies, feelin' super childish, no Donald Glover
Missed call from my mother
Like, ""Where you at tonight?""
Got no alibi

[Pre-Chorus]
I was all alone with the love of my life
She's got glitter for skin
My radiant beam in the night
I don't need no light to see you

[Chorus]
Shine
It's your golden hour (Oh)
You slow down time
In your golden hour (Oh)

[Verse 2]
We were just two lovers
Feet up on the dash, drivin' nowhere fast burnin' through the summer
Radio on blast, make the moment last, she got solar power
Minutes feel like hours
She knew she was the baddest
Can you even imagine fallin' like I did


[Pre-Chorus]
For the love of my life?
She's got glow on her face
A glorious look in her eyes
My angel of light
I was all alone with the love of my life
She's got glitter for skin
My radiant beam in the night (Ah)
I don't need no light to see you

[Chorus]
Shine
It's your golden hour (Oh)
You slow down time
In your golden hour (Oh)

I wanna be your vacuum cleaner
Breathin' in your dust
I wanna be your Ford Cortina
I will never rust
If you like your coffee hot
Let me be your coffee pot
You call the shots, babe
I just wanna be yours

[Pre-Chorus]
Secrets I have held in my heart
Are harder to hide than I thought
Maybe I just wanna be yours

[Chorus]
I wanna be yours
I wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours

[Verse 2]
Let me be your 'leccy meter
An' I'll never run out
Let me be the portable heater
That you'll get cold without
I wanna be your setting lotion (Wanna be)
Hold your hair in deep devotion (How deep?)
At least as deep as the Pacific Ocean
I wanna be yours


[Pre-Chorus]
Secrets I have held in my heart
Are harder to hide than I thought
Maybe I just wanna be yours

[Chorus]
I wanna be yours
I wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours

I will never rust (Wanna be yours)

I just wanna be yours (Wanna be yours)
I just wanna be yours (Wanna be yours)",183956,False,0.464,0.417,0,-9.345,0,0.0256,0.136,0.022,0.0974,0.479,67.528,4,garage
